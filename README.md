# Social-Network-Ads-Machine-Learning-Project
In this project, we have to tell whether a person has bought through a ad or not.
In the given data set we have 5 columns, which are: User ID, Gender, Age, Estimated Salary and he/she has bought through that ad or not.
If he/she has bought through that ad, then it was denoted by 1, otherwise 0.
Firstly, I have done this with Logistic Regression, and came up with an accuracy of 65.83%
Then, I did simple KNN algorithm, and got **76.67%** of accuracy.
